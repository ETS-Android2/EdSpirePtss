# EdSpirePtss
September 2021 - December 2021

EdSpire is an Android Mobile Application for all students in Polytechnic Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin.
This is my Final Year Project as an IT diploma student that specialized in Software & Application Development

This app has 3 main objective
1) To develop a mobile application that helps students to input their assignments due date and remind users using notifications in 3 days before the due date.
2) To create an online forum for students to ask questions about their course within the semester.
3) To generate notifications when another user responds to their forum
